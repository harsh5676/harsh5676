# Hi there! Iâ€™m Harshit Raj ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a passionate coder with a keen interest in web development, C++, and data structures. Currently, Iâ€™m diving into Python and expanding my knowledge in networking, computer networks, operating systems, and ethical hacking.

While Iâ€™m still in the process of developing my skills and donâ€™t have any projects to showcase just yet, Iâ€™m excited about the journey ahead and eager to learn and grow.

When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me cheering for my favorite football team, FC Barcelona, or playing the beautiful game myself.

Feel free to connect with me or check back for updates as I embark on this coding adventure!
